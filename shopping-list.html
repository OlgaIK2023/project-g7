            <p class="text-discription">David Burroughs was once a devoted father to his three-year-old son Matthew,
                living a
                dream life just a short
                drive away
                from the working-class suburb where he and his wife, Cheryl, first fell in love--until one fateful
                night
                when
                David woke
                suddenly to discover Matthew had been murdered while David was asleep just down the hall.</p>
